.. _about_regreg:

==================
The RegReg project
==================

RegReg is a simple multi-algorithm Python framework for prototyping and solving regularized regression problems such as the LASSO. The goal is to enable practitioners to quickly and easily experiment with a variety of different models and choices of regularization. In that spirit, the emphasis is on the flexibility of the framework instead of computational speed for any particular problem.

For a quick introduction, take a look at the :ref:`tutorial` and the :ref:`gallery`.

For more details, see the :ref:`algorithms` page.

If you are interested in contributing as a developer, please see the :ref:`agenda` page.
